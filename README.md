👋 Hi I'm Aimée! Or you can just call me mae.

I'm pursuing my undergrad degree in Material Science Engineering at the University of Toronto.
I have a deep passion for computer programming because I find great satisfaction in solving real-world problems through code.
Especially since figuring out code can be its own problem to solve. 
Specifically, I'm eager to expand my knowledge in web development to complement my previous experiment in website design.
Additionally, I want to learn languages for an engineering application.

🌱I'm currently learning:
- Python
- HTML

I'm hoping to expand my knowledge of these languages and hopefully Javascript eventually.

📫Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/aimeetai)

🙏 I'm always open to feedback, tips and collaboration opportunities. Let's learn together!
